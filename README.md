# CodeFellowship
For your remaining labs before the midterm project, you’ll create an app called CodeFellowship that allows people learning to code to connect with each other and support each other on their coding journeys.

## Feature Tasks
   Build an app that allows users to create their profile on CodeFellowship.
   
- The site should have a splash page at the root route (/) that contains basic information about the site, as well as a link to the “sign up” page.
- An ApplicationUser should have a username, password ( hashed using BCrypt), firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, bio, and any other fields you think are useful.
- The site should allow users to create an ApplicationUser on the “sign up” page.
- Your Controller should have an @Autowired private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder; and use that to run passwordEncoder.encode(password) before saving the password into the new user.
- The site should have a page which allows viewing the data about a single ApplicationUser, at a route like /users/{id}.
- This should include a default profile picture, which is the same for every user, and their basic information.
- Using the above cheat sheet, add the ability for users to log in to your app.
- Upon logging in, users should be taken to a / myprofile route that displays their information.
- Ensure that user registration also logs users into your app automatically.
- The site should be reasonably styled. (This can be using CSS that you did not create yourself.)
- The site should contain integration testing. At a minimum, there should be tests to ensure basic functionality for the splash page and the sign up page.

## Running Application
- Application runs on localhost:8080
- Dependencies are already install just run `gradle bootRun`
